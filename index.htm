<p>I am a recently graduated Masters student from Indian Statistical Institute. I am interested in algebraic topology, specifically stable homotopy theory. I am looking for PhD positions.<br> I can be contacted at narenez at gmail dot com </p>

<h2>Academic Activity</h2>
<ul><li>I am currently studying about Adams spectral sequences and calculations using the same, under Prof Ramesh Kasilingam (IIT-M).
    I read through part 3 of Stable Homotopy and Generalized Homology, J.F. Adams to understand the construction and convergence of Adams Spectral sequence. 
    I have summarized the contents of the first few chapters in this note: <a href="https://narenpi.github.io/shtnote.pdf">Introduction to Stable Homotopy</a>. (I will update the note soon to include sections on Adams specseq.)</li>
    <li>Serre Spectral Sequences- A <a href="https://narenpi.github.io/serrespecseq.pdf">short note</a> elaborating some examples from Hatcherâ€™s note on Serre spectral sequences. I have written few examples that help explain the basics of Serre specseq. They touch on the basic convergence and naturality properties.</li>
    <li>I did my Masters thesis on quadratic forms and I worked on the proof of the base cases of Milnor's conjecture. <a href="https://narenpi.github.io/masthes.pdf">Report</a></li></ul>
